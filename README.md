# ScreenTime-Analysis
This project analyzes app screentime using Python through a dataset from Kaggle.

I am aiming to predict the amount of time users spend on the app based on various features such as the number of times the app is opened and the number of notifications received. My goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts app usage, helping me understand the factors that contribute to increased or decreased usage.

Analyzing the screen time of a user helps smartphone companies give a review of all the activities of the user on their smartphone. 
It helps users understand if they were productive, creative, or have wasted their time.
